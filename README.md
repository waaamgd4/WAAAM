#  SAFE - Security and Awareness For Everyone

# Project Overview:
SAFE is a non-profitable organization aimed to educate and empower individuals and businesses to protect themselves in an increasingly digital environment. As online activity grows in Egypt, so do the risks of cybercrimes, including fraud, identity theft, and cyberbullying. This organization uses creative graphic design, engaging content, and clear messaging to simplify complex cybersecurity concepts and raise awareness about the importance of safe online practices. It also touches on emerging challenges in the AI era, helping people understand how to safely navigate new technologies and tools. By highlighting key threats and how to respond to them, EDSA encourages a culture of vigilance and digital responsibility.

# Project Objective:
The goal of SAFE is to create a strong foundation of digital safety awareness through powerful visual communication. The organization aims to:

- Increase understanding of common online threats and how to prevent them.

- Provide clear, accessible information on how to respond to incidents like hacking, fraud, or cyberbullying.

- Highlight resources and national support systems and law enforcement channels, to help victims take action.

- Foster trust in digital platforms by educating exporters, importers, and businesses about secure online transactions.

- Promote a nationwide sense of responsibility and resilience in the face of cyber risks through cohesive, impactful design and messaging.

- Introduce the public to safe and responsible use of AI tools, including recognizing AI-generated content, verifying information sources, and using AI as an enhancement tool to improve online security and awareness.

# vision:
Building a safe and aware digital Egyptian community that enjoys trust and knowledge to protect its data and identity in the evolving world of the internet.

# Mission:
Offering innovative awareness and simplified creative content aimed at raising awareness of digital safety in Egypt, and empowering individuals and companies to adopt safe practices that protect their data and digital identity from increasing threats.

# core values: 
 *Empowerment:*
Knowledge is power. The organization equips people to be their own first line of defense, shifting the narrative from fear to capability and countering the disempowerment linked to surveillance and censorship.

# Clarity & Simplicity:
Digital safety can be intimidating. EDSA breaks it down into simple, practical steps—like strong passwords, MFA, phishing awareness, and updates—making security accessible to all.

# Trust & Transparency:
Public trust is vital. The campaign shares information openly, bases advice on global best practices, and is transparent about funding and partnerships to overcome skepticism.

# Collaboration:
Digital safety is a shared responsibility. Edsa will partner with companies, schools, NGOs, and community leaders, amplifying reach and credibility through a broad coalition.
