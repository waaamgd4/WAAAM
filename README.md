#  Hidden Egypt: Discover the Unseen Treasures
Exora is a digital platform that simplifies the export process from Egypt to global markets. The application connects international buyers with verified Egyptian suppliers of raw materials such as coal, marble, textiles, and food products. Instead of searching randomly on social media, buyers can easily browse a structured catalog, communicate directly with exporters, access secure payment methods, and benefit from integrated shipping solutions. Exora makes Egyptian exports more accessible, transparent, and efficient for the global trade community

# Project Idea
Exora is an AI-powered export platform designed to connect global buyers with verified Egyptian suppliers of raw materials. The system makes the export process easier, faster, and more transparent by replacing scattered Facebook searches with a centralized and trusted solution.
